This is our graduation project repository

#Photogrammetry is a technology that allows us to produce 3D models from 2D images. Our graduation project is based on users being able to enter our website and upload images and obtain a 3D model.

Our project, which I wrote the #backend side using #python #flask and the #frontend designs I made on "play.teleporthq.io", is a dynamic website. Signing up on the website, logging in, an email verification link to your e-mail address, a verification code when logging in, and other database operations can be done. Another feature of the site is that you can see and review the 3D model you created on the web pages, create a product page and share the link of the page you created.
